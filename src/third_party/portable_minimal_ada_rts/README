Minimal platform-independent Ada runtime library.
Files copied from the GNAT distro as follows:
- common/*.ad[sb] files came from
  <gnat install dir>/2018-arm-elf/arm-eabi/include/rts-sources/common/
- fpu/*.ad[sb] files came from
  <gnat install dir>/2018-arm-elf/arm-eabi/include/rts-sources/fpu/
- zfp/*.ad[sb] files came from
  <gnat install dir>/2018-arm-elf/arm-eabi/include/rts-sources/zfp/,
  except for system.ads, which was copied from
<gnat install dir>/2018-arm-elf/arm-eabi/BSPs/cortex-m/armv7-m/stm32/stm32f4/zfp/arch/system.ads

The following declarations have been removed from the original system.ads
to make it more portable across platforms:

   Tick                  : constant := 1.0 / 60.0;

   --  Priority-related Declarations (RM D.1)

   Max_Priority           : constant Positive := 30;
   Max_Interrupt_Priority : constant Positive := 31;

   subtype Any_Priority       is Integer      range  0 .. 31;
   subtype Priority           is Any_Priority range  0 .. 30;
   subtype Interrupt_Priority is Any_Priority range 31 .. 31;

   Default_Priority : constant Priority := 15;
