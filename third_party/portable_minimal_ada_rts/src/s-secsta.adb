   --  Return the pointer to the secondary stack of the current task.
   --
   --  The package imports this function to permit flexibility in the storage
   --  of secondary stacks pointers to support a range of different ZFP and
   --  other restricted run-time scenarios without needing to recompile the
   --  run-time. A ZFP run-time will typically include a default implementation
   --  suitable for single thread applications (s-sssita.adb). However, users
   --  can replace this implementation by providing their own as part of their
   --  program (for example, if multiple threads need to be supported in a ZFP
   --  application).
   --
   --  Many Ravenscar run-times also use this mechanism to provide switch
   --  between efficient single task and multitask implementations without
   --  depending on System.Soft_Links.
   --
   --  In all cases, the binder will generate a default-sized secondary stack
   --  for the environment task if the secondary stack is used by the program
   --  being binded.
   --
   --  To support multithreaded ZFP-based applications, the binder supports
   --  the creation of additional secondary stacks using the -Qnnn binder
   --  switch. For the user to make use of these generated stacks, all threads
   --  need to call SS_Init with a null-object parameter to be assigned a
   --  stack. It is then the responsibility of the user to store the returned
   --  pointer in a way that can be can retrieved via the user implementation
   --  of the __gnat_get_secondary_stack function. In this scenario it is
   --  recommended to use thread local variables. For example, if the
   --  Thread_Local_Storage aspect is supported on the target:
