Minimal platform-independent Ada runtime library.
Files copied from the FSF GNAT RTS sources.

The following declarations have been removed from the original
`system.ads` file, to make it more portable across platforms:

   Tick                  : constant := 1.0 / 60.0;

   --  Priority-related Declarations (RM D.1)

   Max_Priority           : constant Positive := 30;
   Max_Interrupt_Priority : constant Positive := 31;

   subtype Any_Priority       is Integer      range  0 .. 31;
   subtype Priority           is Any_Priority range  0 .. 30;
   subtype Interrupt_Priority is Any_Priority range 31 .. 31;

   Default_Priority : constant Priority := 15;
